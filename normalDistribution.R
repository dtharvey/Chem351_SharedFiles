# examine help file for functions related to normal distributions

help(Normal)

# each function takes the mean and the standard deviation as arguments, with
# default value of 0 and 1, respectively; lower.tail is a logical argument that
# specifies if we are interested in values below a stated value (the default) or
# above the stated value

# rnorm: returns vector of n random samples drawn from a normal distribution

# dnorm: returns value of f(x), the probability or density, for normal distribution

# prorm: returns probability of a result â‰¤ x if lower.tail = TRUE; returns
# probability of a result > x is lower.tail = FALSE

# qnorm: returns value of x for which the range -inf to x has the probability p

# create a sample of normally distributed data and examine the sample
